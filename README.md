CPI Data Analysis Project

Project Overview
The project analyzes Consumer Price Index (CPI) trends across Rural, Urban, and Combined sectors, focusing on inflationary impacts and sectoral disparities up to September 2014. The analysis includes:

Identifying correlations between key indices such as Health, Housing, and Food.
Performing hypothesis testing to compare Rural and Urban sector trends.
Generating insights through statistical analysis and visualizations.
The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (Programming.ipynb) for the analysis and a presentation (Presentation.pptx) summarizing the results.

Data Source: The dataset used in this project was obtained from data.gov.in.

Repository Contents
Programming.ipynb:

Performs data cleaning and preparation.
Generates visualizations such as heatmaps and trend charts.
Conducts statistical analysis, including T-tests, to validate findings.
Presentation.pptx:

Summarizes key findings, visualizations, and conclusions.

Key Insights
Inflation Trends: General Index shows a steady rise, with Rural areas exhibiting greater sensitivity to inflation.
Sectoral Comparisons: Statistically significant differences between Rural and Urban CPI trends were identified through T-tests.
Policy Implications: Highlights the need for targeted measures to address inflationary impacts, particularly in Rural areas.
