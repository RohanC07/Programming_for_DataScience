Overview:
This repository contains Python programs developed for the analysis of Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. The programs focus on:

Exploring CPI trends across Rural, Urban, and Combined sectors.
Visualizing key metrics like Health, Housing, and Food indices.
Performing statistical tests, including T-tests, to compare sectoral differences.
Generating insights through correlation analysis and other visualizations.
Descriptions:
data_analysis.ipynb or data_analysis.py:

Performs data cleaning, transformation, and preparation for analysis.
Generates visualizations (e.g., trends, distribution charts, heatmaps).
Includes hypothesis testing and summary statistics computation.
visualizations.ipynb or visualizations.py:

Focuses on creating detailed visualizations for CPI trends and relationships between indices.
Exports figures for use in presentations or reports.
Data Files:

Contains the dataset(s) used in the analysis, ensuring reproducibility.
Python Packages Used
The following Python packages are required to run the code:

pandas (Data manipulation and analysis)
numpy (Numerical computations)
matplotlib (Data visualization)
seaborn (Advanced visualization, such as heatmaps)
scipy (Statistical tests, including T-tests)
